Answer the following questions using your Scala Basics Knowledge!

SOLUTIONS

1. What is 2 to the power of 5 ?

  scala> math.pow(2,5)
  res39: Double = 32.0

2. What is the remainder of 180 divided by 7?

  scala> 180%7
  res40: Int = 5

3. Given variable pet_name = "Sammy", use string interpolation to print out
 "My dog's name is Sammy."

  scala> s"My dog's name is ${pet_name}"
  res42: String = My dog's name is Sammy

  scala> f"My dog's name is $pet_name"
  res43: String = My dog's name is Sammy

4. Use scala to find out if the letter sequence "xyz" is contained in:
"sadfjshfjyuyxyzjkfuidkjklhasyysdfk"

  scala> val s = "sadfjshfjyuyxyzjkfuidkjklhasyysdfk"
  s: String = sadfjshfjyuyxyzjkfuidkjklhasyysdfk

  scala> s contains "xyz"
  res45: Boolean = true

5. What is the difference between a value and a variable?

A value is an immutable storage unit, it can be assigned data when defined but
can not be reassigned.

A variable is a mutable storage unit, data can be assigned at definition and
reassigned later on.

6. Given the tuple (1,2,3,(4,5,6)) retrieve the number 6.

  scala> val t = (1,2,3,(4,5,6))
  t: (Int, Int, Int, (Int, Int, Int)) = (1,2,3,(4,5,6))

  scala> t._4
  res49: (Int, Int, Int) = (4,5,6)

  scala> t._4._3
  res50: Int = 6
